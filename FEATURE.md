# What is the feature?

Our group aimed to implement a feature that would allow for a user to be more expressive in their appearance in Covey.Town through the use of multiple character options. The feature’s implementation allows a user to change their desired appearance from the default tuxemon misa sprite model to several distinct recolors, and builds the infrastructure to allow for other, more unique designs to be built upon, should a future design team wish to do so.

# What the feature is aiming to allow you to do

Through the feature, a user is able to make themselves distinctly recognizable when playing with multiple people. The user has the ability to easily preview their avatar’s appearance before making their final decision in the login page. For the more indecisive user, there is the option of a randomize button which will select one of the looks for the user, or they may choose to skip the process entirely and go with the pre-selected default appearance.

# Walkthrough and how to use the feature

To use the feature, you will need to select an appearance before joining a town. When logging in to Covey.Town on the main town selection screen, select one of the 4 appearance options listed under the “username” input box. Selecting this will lock your appearance in place for your given session of Covey.Town, and is only finalized once you join a game. You can also click the “Randomize” word underneath the 4 option boxes to have one of them be selected at random. If you don’t make any selection, you will have the default appearance of the original blond misa sprite.

# How to tell it's working

When you load into the game after selecting an appearance, your individual sprite choice will retain the appearance you selected, and be visible to all other players who interact with you in the game.
